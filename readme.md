My exchange does not show gains and losses well on positions.  So I built this to help out.

Calls the https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#operation/getV1CryptocurrencyQuotesLatest API and builds a result with your portfolio show gains and losses.

You will need a API key from coinmarketcap.  Note that different exchanges have different prices.  

Update data.json with your own info and config.json with your own api key.
